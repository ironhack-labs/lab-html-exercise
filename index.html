    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and    
        typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
        text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled 
        it to make a type specimen book.<br><em>It has survived not only five centuries, 
        but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
        </em> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
