            Node.js is an open-source server environment. Node.js is cross-platform and runs on Windows, Linux, Unix, and macOS.
            Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
            Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The functionality of running scripts server-side
            produces dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,
            unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
