1. In index.html, links to images point to my personnal D Drive. 
Example: <img class="blackHeart" src="D:\ironhack\Prework-Projects\lab-html-exercise\lab-html-exercise\images\black-heart.png" alt="black-heart">. 
Will it be possible to review the webpage with images on Github in this case or should I do things differently?

2. The given npm website example is a fixed image therefore it does not take into account the impact of resizing the webpage window on the look/placement of elements in the webpage. I've mainly used min-width/max-width to keep things consistent with different window sizes, is it the right method?

3. I've imported a second Poppins font because I did not manage to have headers look as thick as in the example. I've tried to use font-weight 900 but it did not work. Was there another solution?

4. I haven't used #id at all, only .classes. Is it ok or should I use both?
