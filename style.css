"See plans" button background color: #FB3B49

SECTION 2: pretty much the same layout as the previous - some code to be reused
heading background color: rgba(255,204,53,.4)
to get the transform of the yellow background in the left-hand direction use: transform: skew(9deg,0deg);
to get it in the opposite direction of the letters, the way we need it on the page, use: font-style: italic;
to additionally fine-tune the position of each element, use margin property.
Use a lot of flexbox to get the right position of elements - direction, justify-content, align-items.
Inspect elements to get the right size of the font for each of them.s
